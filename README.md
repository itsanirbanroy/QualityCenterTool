# QualityCenterTool
This tool is to update multiple Test Case steps automatically in a bulk. It is an HTA application developed using Quality Center OTA Api. Feel free to use this in your project.

Problem:
At times because of any project changes, we have to do the same changes in multiple test cases. QC does not have any feature to update the test case steps

How it is useful:  
*Any user can log on and connect to any of their QC project database.  
*User can specify multiple test case ids to make the changes  
*User can update any specific step or all the steps  
*User can do Find/Replace or fully update steps.  

How to use:  
*Install QC ALM Connectivity addin (TDConnect.exe) by going to Help | Add-Ins Page.  
*Save the file as .hta file , double click the file to open  
*Enter QC server url, username & password to connect to your project.
